# Deadlock-Detection-in-Database-Transactions

## Overview
This project, part of the Operating Systems Lab at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of Manipal Institute of Technology, focuses on investigating, simulating, and resolving deadlocks in database transactions. Our aim is to enhance the understanding of deadlock detection principles and develop practical solutions to manage them in contemporary database systems.


## Problem Statement
Deadlocks in database systems pose a significant challenge to the reliability and efficiency of database management systems. This project addresses the need to detect and resolve these deadlocks effectively, thereby ensuring smoother and more efficient database operations.

## Project Components
*Literature Review: In-depth analysis of existing research in deadlock detection.
*Simulation Model: Developed in Python and SQL, simulating the deadlock detection process.
*Algorithm Implementation: Implementing and testing various deadlock detection and resolution strategies.
*Case Studies: Analyzing real-world scenarios to understand the impact of deadlocks.
*Data Analysis: Evaluating the effectiveness of implemented solutions.
## Technical Details
*Programming Languages: Python, SQL
*Database Management: MySQL
*Tools: Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub for version control
*Logging: Transaction logs stored for monitoring and debugging purposes
## Setup and Installation
